                Hi, my name’s Matt! I am a Flight Instructor from Ogden, Utah.
                Flying for a living tends to lead to some pretty amazing views,
                and I found that my phone’s camera just never did it any
                justice. I decided to invest in a used DSLR camera, and the rest
                is history! I’m always learning a lot, and enjoy taking pictures
                from the air and the ground. Thanks for paying me a visit!
            </p>
